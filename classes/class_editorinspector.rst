EditorInspector
===============

**Inherits:** :ref:`ScrollContainer<class_ScrollContainer>` **<** :ref:`Container<class_Container>` **<** :ref:`Control<class_Control>` **<** :ref:`CanvasItem<class_CanvasItem>` **<** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A control used to edit properties of an object.

Description
-----------

This is the control that implements property editing in the editor's Settings dialogs, the Inspector dock, etc. To get the ``EditorInspector`` used in the editor's Inspector dock, use :ref:`EditorInterface.get_inspector<class_EditorInterface_method_get_inspector>`.

\ ``EditorInspector`` will show properties in the same order as the array returned by :ref:`Object.get_property_list<class_Object_method_get_property_list>`.

If a property's name is path-like (i.e. if it contains forward slashes), ``EditorInspector`` will create nested sections for "directories" along the path. For example, if a property is named ``highlighting/gdscript/node_path_color``, it will be shown as "Node Path Color" inside the "GDScript" section nested inside the "Highlighting" section.

If a property has :ref:`@GlobalScope.PROPERTY_USAGE_GROUP<class_@GlobalScope_constant_PROPERTY_USAGE_GROUP>` usage, it will group subsequent properties whose name starts with the property's hint string. The group ends when a property does not start with that hint string or when a new group starts. An empty group name effectively ends the current group. ``EditorInspector`` will create a top-level section for each group. For example, if a property with group usage is named ``Collide With`` and its hint string is ``collide_with_``, a subsequent ``collide_with_area`` property will be shown as "Area" inside the "Collide With" section.

If a property has :ref:`@GlobalScope.PROPERTY_USAGE_SUBGROUP<class_@GlobalScope_constant_PROPERTY_USAGE_SUBGROUP>` usage, a subgroup will be created in the same way as a group, and a second-level section will be created for each subgroup.

\ **Note:** Unlike sections created from path-like property names, ``EditorInspector`` won't capitalize the name for sections created from groups. So properties with group usage usually use capitalized names instead of snake_cased names.

Signals
-------

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_edited_object_changed:

- **edited_object_changed** **(** **)**

Emitted when the object being edited by the inspector has changed.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_object_id_selected:

- **object_id_selected** **(** :ref:`int<class_int>` id **)**

Emitted when the Edit button of an :ref:`Object<class_Object>` has been pressed in the inspector. This is mainly used in the remote scene tree inspector.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_property_deleted:

- **property_deleted** **(** :ref:`String<class_String>` property **)**

Emitted when a property is removed from the inspector.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_property_edited:

- **property_edited** **(** :ref:`String<class_String>` property **)**

Emitted when a property is edited in the inspector.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_property_keyed:

- **property_keyed** **(** :ref:`String<class_String>` property, :ref:`Variant<class_Variant>` value, :ref:`bool<class_bool>` advance **)**

Emitted when a property is keyed in the inspector. Properties can be keyed by clicking the "key" icon next to a property when the Animation panel is toggled.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_property_selected:

- **property_selected** **(** :ref:`String<class_String>` property **)**

Emitted when a property is selected in the inspector.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_property_toggled:

- **property_toggled** **(** :ref:`String<class_String>` property, :ref:`bool<class_bool>` checked **)**

Emitted when a boolean property is toggled in the inspector.

\ **Note:** This signal is never emitted if the internal ``autoclear`` property enabled. Since this property is always enabled in the editor inspector, this signal is never emitted by the editor itself.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_resource_selected:

- **resource_selected** **(** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` resource, :ref:`String<class_String>` path **)**

Emitted when a resource is selected in the inspector.

----

.. _class_EditorInspector_signal_restart_requested:

- **restart_requested** **(** **)**

Emitted when a property that requires a restart to be applied is edited in the inspector. This is only used in the Project Settings and Editor Settings.

Method Descriptions
-------------------

.. _class_EditorInspector_method_get_selected_path:

- :ref:`String<class_String>` **get_selected_path** **(** **)** |const|

Gets the path of the currently selected property.

.. |virtual| replace:: :abbr:`virtual (This method should typically be overridden by the user to have any effect.)`
.. |const| replace:: :abbr:`const (This method has no side effects. It doesn't modify any of the instance's member variables.)`
.. |vararg| replace:: :abbr:`vararg (This method accepts any number of arguments after the ones described here.)`
.. |constructor| replace:: :abbr:`constructor (This method is used to construct a type.)`
.. |static| replace:: :abbr:`static (This method doesn't need an instance to be called, so it can be called directly using the class name.)`
.. |operator| replace:: :abbr:`operator (This method describes a valid operator to use with this type as left-hand operand.)`
